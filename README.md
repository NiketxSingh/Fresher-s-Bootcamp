# 🎯 AfterShot

**A fast-paced action platformer where your every shot lingers — and turns against you.**

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

You are an archer trapped in an endless arena.  
Each arrow you fire **never despawns** — instead, it becomes a **hazard** that can kill you.  
Use precision, movement, and timing to eliminate enemies while avoiding your own chaos.  

To advance, **defeat the required number of enemies** in each level and survive your own crossfire.
